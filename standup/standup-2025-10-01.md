# Standup — 2025-09-30

## Yesterday (Summary)

- Stabilized and cleaned the week-view scheduling component after accidental file corruption: replaced corrupted `ScheduleCalendar.jsx` with a minimal clean implementation, then iteratively restored the full calendar implementation with DnD handlers and visual polish.
- Implemented frontend scheduling feature (feature/frontend-scheduling-interface): added `ScheduleCalendar.jsx`, `scheduleHelpers.js`, and unit tests for helpers. DnD behavior, DragOverlay, dashed drop placeholder, and soft overlap detection implemented.
- Created and pushed `feature/visual-update` from `development-frontend`. Merged `feature/frontend-scheduling-interface` into `development-frontend` and then into `feature/visual-update` (sync operation to bring avatar upload and other frontend changes).
- Fixed merge conflicts where present (merge was completed with the 'ort' strategy and pushed to remote).
- Stashed and restored local changes to `flask/data/app.db` during branch operations to keep working tree clean.

## Blockers / Issues

- `ScheduleCalendar.jsx` became corrupted during iterative automated edits and required multiple replacements; resolved by replacing with a clean single-component file.
- Frontend lint previously failed (`npm run --prefix react lint` exit 1). Recommend running lint on the merged branch and fixing stylistic issues.
- Local DB file `flask/data/app.db` remains modified and unstaged after stash/pop — decide whether to commit or discard.

## Today (Plan / Timebox)

- 09:00 — 09:30: Run frontend linter on `feature/visual-update`, fix any critical lint errors that block build.
- 09:30 — 10:30: Start the frontend dev server (vite) and visually validate `ScheduleCalendar` styles against Figma screenshots; iterate on Tailwind classes.
- 10:30 — 11:00: Replace native confirm with in-app modal for overlap conflict flow (if time allows) and add one unit test for the `scheduleHelpers.timeOverlap` behavior.
- 11:00 — 12:00: Polish visuals (rounded cards, navy primary button, dashed placeholders, DragOverlay darkness), finalize UI.
- 13:00 — 14:00: Create PR from `feature/visual-update` into `development-frontend` with a clear description and link related issues.

## Risks / Next Steps

- Risk: Lint failures or package lock deletions may introduce variations across dev machines. Mitigation: run `npm ci` in `react/` and re-generate `package-lock.json` if needed.
- Next: Confirm whether to commit `flask/data/app.db` or keep it local-only. Decide whether to replace native confirm with app modal now or after visual polish.

## Artifacts

- Files added/modified: `react/src/components/schedule/ScheduleCalendar.jsx`, `react/src/components/schedule/scheduleHelpers.js`, `react/src/components/schedule/__tests__/ScheduleCalendar.test.jsx`, updates to `react/src/pages/SchedulePage.jsx`, docs/feature-frontend-scheduling-interface.md
- Branches: `feature/frontend-scheduling-interface` -> merged into `development-frontend` -> pushed; new branch `feature/visual-update` created from `development-frontend` and checked out.
