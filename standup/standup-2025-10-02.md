# Standup — 2025-10-02

## Yesterday — summary
- Repaired and replaced a corrupted schedule component: restored a single clean implementation of react/src/components/schedule/ScheduleCalendar.jsx with DnD, DragOverlay, dashed drop placeholder, and overlap detection.
- Merged scheduling feature branches into `development-frontend` multiple times and created follow-up feature branches for visual & functional work.
- Created branch `feature/visual-update` for UI polish; created `feature/analytics-dashboard`, `feature/menu-enhancement`, `feature/user-page-enhancement`, and `feature/scheduling-enhancement` from `development-frontend`.
- Added documentation: `docs/backend-fault-tolerance-plan.md` (HA Postgres, redundant app servers, proxy failover).
- Created/updated GitHub issues and task lists to reflect completed subtasks (scheduling, menu availability, role-based routing, parts of analytics).
- Stabilized repository state: merged feature branches and pushed changes; created standup note and fixed markdown spacing.

## Done (concrete)
- Schedule calendar file cleaned and reimplemented.
- `feature/frontend-scheduling-interface` merged -> `development-frontend`.
- `feature/visual-update` branch created and published.
- `feature/analytics-dashboard`, `feature/menu-enhancement`, `feature/user-page-enhancement`, `feature/scheduling-enhancement` branches created.
- `docs/backend-fault-tolerance-plan.md` added.
- Issues updated: marked completed subtasks for scheduling (#13), menu availability (#12), auth routing (#11), initial analytics items (#14/#10), menu search/filter (#8). New follow-up issues created for visual polish, lint/CI, and DB handling.

## Blockers & risks
- Frontend lint failures reported; need to run and fix (`react` workspace).
- Local DB file (`flask/data/app.db`) handling is unresolved — decide ignore vs commit/read-only seed.
- Overlap confirmation currently uses native confirm; should replace with in-app modal for better UX.
- Potential merge/lint fallout if large refactor to MVVM is started without incremental plan.

## Today — plan
- Run frontend linter on `feature/scheduling-enhancement`, collect reported errors, and fix high-priority issues.
- Start visual QA for ScheduleCalendar on `feature/visual-update`: adjust Tailwind classes for spacing, rounded cards, button color, overlay.
- Implement small scheduling enhancements on `feature/scheduling-enhancement` (UX polish and modal replacement plan).
- Run dev server and verify Schedule page and Analytics dashboard render without runtime errors.
- Post final updates to related GitHub issues and open PR(s) when lint and QA pass.

## Next steps / acceptance criteria
- Lint: `npm run --prefix react lint` passes on feature branches.
- Visual: Schedule calendar matches Figma key elements (rounded cards, navy primary button, dashed placeholder).
- UX: Overlap confirmation replaced by app modal and covered by at least one unit test.
- Merge: Open PR `feature/visual-update` → `development-frontend` with screenshots and link reviewers.
