- Imports / Libraries
- Declaration / init
- Functions
- main

#### Notes:
- Assume the role of a senior developer
- Always includes validation for arguments
- Always catch errors and do error handling
- refrain from code duplications
- Prefer one-liner if possible
- create test-cases to test functions
- use minimum external libraries as much as  possible
- functions generated should be concise and do only 1 responibility at a time
- Take consideration to Big O notation for performance purpose
- libraries used must not be deprecated
- adopt mvvm for applications
- create folders for files structuring
- md documentation should include the functions / application description as well
- for applications, always provides an exit execution
