# Standup — 2025-10-01

## Yesterday (Summary)

- Stabilized and restored the week-view scheduling component after file corruption, re-implementing drag-and-drop behaviors and visual polish in `ScheduleCalendar.jsx` plus helper/unit-test coverage.
- Finished the frontend scheduling feature work on `feature/frontend-scheduling-interface` and merged it into `development-frontend`, keeping local DB changes stashed to avoid noise.
- Captured progress in standup documentation and ensured the scheduling helpers/tests were green.

## Blockers / Issues

- Frontend lint is still failing on the merged scheduling work (`npm run --prefix react lint` exit 1); follow-up tracked in issue #23.
- Decision needed on handling `flask/data/app.db` in version control (issue #24) — currently relies on local stashes.
- Overlap confirmation still uses `window.confirm`; replacement in-app modal planned in #22.

## Today (Progress So Far)

- Produced updated standup notes (09/30 and 10/01) and summarized progress across GitHub issues (#22–#25) while marking scheduling issue #13 as `ready-for-qa`.
- Merged `feature/visual-update` and `feature/analytics-dashboard` back into `development-frontend`, then cut new branches `feature/analytics-dashboard` and `feature/menu-enhancement` for upcoming work.
- Verified frontend builds after analytics updates (`npm run build`) and pushed the new branches to origin.

## Today (Plan / Timebox)

- 10:30 — 11:30: Audit `MenuPage` and related components to document enhancement requirements and align with design expectations.
- 11:30 — 13:00: Implement menu enhancements (improved filtering UX, detail views, availability toggles) on `feature/menu-enhancement` with incremental commits.
- 13:00 — 14:00: Add/update unit tests for menu utilities/components and run `npm run test` / `npm run lint` to keep CI green.
- 14:00 — 15:00: Prepare screenshots, polish copy, and draft PR notes referencing issues #12 and #23.

## Risks / Next Steps

- Risk: Menu enhancements may expand scope (e.g., pricing UI); keep changes scoped and create follow-up issues as needed.
- Next: Resolve lint failures (#23) in parallel with menu work, and finalize the DB-handling decision (#24) before release branching.

## Artifacts

- Files touched recently: `react/src/components/analytics/AnalyticsSummary.jsx`, `react/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.jsx`, standup notes under `standup/`, scheduling helpers/tests.
- Branches: `feature/visual-update` and `feature/analytics-dashboard` merged into `development-frontend`; active work now on `feature/menu-enhancement`.
